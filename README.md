UniverseCraft Omega Public Code [Written in Skript]

You've found it! This is the repository where I keep all the Skript code that I'm working on for other servers. It's currently not much, but it'll grow as my projects grow. 
A lot of the code I use is in a privately stored repository on my computer, but when someone I work for requests that code, I upload it here so that it can be accessed by the auto-updaters I write.

UniverseCraft Omega and LeadDeveloper

UniverseCraft Omega is really two things: the Minecraft server itself that runs the code I write, and the development studio behind it. 
The server's code is private, but the code I write for other servers that need auto-updaters appears here. 

I am LeadDeveloper, the Lead Developer (you guessed it!) behind UniverseCraft Omega. I founded it, own it, and develop it. I also singlehandedly develop code for other servers to use.

If you own or know about a Minecraft server that needs development help, my contact info and pricing is posted below:
